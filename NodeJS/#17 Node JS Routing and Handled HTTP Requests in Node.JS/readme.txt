Here's the explanation for each part of the code:

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => { ... });: This line creates an HTTP server instance using the createServer method from the http module. The provided callback function will be invoked every time a request is made to the server. The callback function takes two arguments: req (the request object) and res (the response object).

if (req.url === '/') { ... } else if (req.url === '/about') { ... } else { ... }: This block of code checks the req.url property, which represents the path portion of the URL that the client is requesting. It determines which content to serve based on the URL path.

if (req.url === '/') { ... }: If the URL path is '/', which represents the root path, the server responds with a status code 200 (OK) and sets the content type header to 'text/html'. Then, it sends an HTML response body containing a welcome message for the homepage.

else if (req.url === '/about') { ... }: If the URL path is '/about', the server again responds with a status code 200 and a content type header of 'text/html'. It sends an HTML response body containing information about the "About Us" page.

else { ... }: If the URL path doesn't match either '/' or '/about', the server responds with a status code 404 (Not Found) and a content type header of 'text/html'. It sends an HTML response body indicating that the requested page was not found.

res.writeHead(statusCode, headers): This method is used to set the HTTP status code and headers for the response. Depending on the route (URL path) detected, the appropriate status code (200 for success or 404 for not found) and content type header ('text/html') are set.

res.end(body): This method sends the response body content to the client. It is used to finish the response and send it back to the client. The response body in this case is an HTML message that corresponds to the requested route.

In summary, the provided code creates a basic HTTP server that handles requests based on the requested URL path. It serves different HTML content for the root path (/) and the /about path, while returning a "404 Not Found" message for any other paths. This is a simple example of routing and handling different routes in a Node.js server.
