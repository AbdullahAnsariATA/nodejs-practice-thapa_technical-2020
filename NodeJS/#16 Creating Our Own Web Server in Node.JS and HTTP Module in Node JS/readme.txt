Here's what this code does:

It imports the http module, which is a built-in module in Node.js that allows you to create HTTP servers and handle HTTP requests and responses.

It creates an HTTP server using the http.createServer() method. This server listens for incoming HTTP requests and provides a callback function that will be called whenever a request is received.

In the callback function, we set the response header to indicate that we are sending plain text ('Content-Type': 'text/plain') and set the status code to 200 (OK).

We send the "Hello, World!" message as the response body using the res.end() method.

We define the port and hostname for the server to listen on (in this case, it's listening on localhost on port 3000).

Finally, we start the server and listen on the specified port and hostname. When the server starts, it logs a message to the console to indicate that it's running.
